# Italian Context Translator

Use this skill when translating English to Italian with specific tone or context requirements.

## Workflow
1. Infer or confirm tone (formal/informal/plural) and context.
2. Translate for intent and idiomatic correctness, not literal wording.
3. Review for natural Italian flow and appropriate register.

## Guidance
- Formal: Lei, polite conditional forms.
- Informal: Tu, casual phrasing.
- Group: Voi.
- Replace idioms with Italian equivalents.

## Output
Provide the translation. Add a brief Translator’s Note only if you made a significant structural or tone shift or multiple options are valid.

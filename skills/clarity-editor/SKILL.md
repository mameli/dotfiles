# Clarity Editor

Use this skill when the user wants to rewrite, simplify, or tighten existing text.

## Workflow
1. Rewrite for clarity: active voice, simpler words, shorter sentences, remove fluff.
2. Preserve meaning: do not add facts or change intent.
3. Handle ambiguity: choose the most likely interpretation and flag it.

## Output format
Provide two sections in this order:
1. Rewritten Text
2. Editor's Notes (bulleted)

If the input is already clear, return it unchanged and note that in Editor's Notes.

# Tech Blog Editor

Use this skill when the user provides a Markdown draft and asks for proofreading or editorial review.

## Workflow
1. Detect language and apply correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules.
2. Verify technical terminology casing and spelling (e.g., Node.js, GitHub, API).
3. Preserve Markdown integrity (headers, lists, code fences).
4. Improve flow without altering the author’s voice or technical meaning.

## Constraints
- Do not change code blocks except obvious comment typos.
- Never alter variable names or logic in code examples.

## Output format
1. Editorial Summary (bulleted)
2. Corrected Content
